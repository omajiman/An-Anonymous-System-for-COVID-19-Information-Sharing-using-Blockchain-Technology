# An-Anonymous-System-for-COVID-19-Information-Sharing-using-Blockchain-Technology
This paper proposes a blockchain-based anonymous system, known as GarliMediChain, for providing anonymity and privacy during COVID-19 information sharing. In GarliMediChain, garlic routing and blockchain are integrated to provide low-latency communication, privacy, anonymity, trust and security. Also, COVID-19 information is encrypted multiple times before transmitting to a series of nodes in the network. To ensure that COVID-19 information is successfully shared, a blockchain-based coalition system is proposed. The coalition system enables health institutions to share information while maximizing their payoffs. Furthermore, each institution uses the proposed fictitious play to study the strategies of others in order to update its belief by selecting the best responses from them. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed system prevents honest-but-curious institution from attacking the system. Nonetheless, the proposed GarliMediChain system promotes global collaborations by combining existing anonymity and trust solutions with the support of blockchain technology.
